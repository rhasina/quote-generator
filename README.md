# Quote Generator
OpenClassrooms Front-End Developer path project: 'Create a quotation generator'.
## Introduction
Each quote consists of 3 parts that are randomly chosen from a list of possibilities.

There are 2 versions of the Quote Generator:
- version 1: this is the simpler one with one category. The user can generate only one quote.
- version 2: it allows the user to choose between 2 sets (categories) of quotes, and select the number of quotes that they
want to generate, knowing that the number is 1 to 5.

Try the version 2 of the Quote Generator here: [Quote Generator](https://rhasina.github.io/quote-generator/)
